Shakespeare Prose (shakespeare.txt file included)

Use KERAS to compile and fit a Convolutional Neural Network on the internal MNIST handwritten numbers image data set. 
Use KERAS to fit a Recurrent Neural Network on a piece of shakespear prose to predict the next word in a phrase.  Analageous to the next word on in the google search bar or on a mobile text messaging device.

You must have Keras, with Tensor Flow installed to run these files.
